// Touch-press handling for list rows. A phone has no right-click, so long-press
// is the only way into a selection — and it has to be careful about it:
//
//   · a press that turns into a scroll must not select (the slop check)
//   · the tap that ends a long press must not also open/play the row (the
//     `consumed` flag, which the click handler clears)
//   · the browser's own long-press behaviour (text selection, callout menu)
//     has to be suppressed, which is what preventing contextmenu does
//
// Returns one stable handler object, so it can be spread onto a memoized row
// without defeating the memo.
//
// Being a hook, this only works where each row is its own component. Files
// renders its rows from a plain `renderRow` function inside the view, where a
// per-row hook call would break the rules of hooks — it carries an equivalent
// inline implementation instead, and would need its rows extracted into
// components before it could share this one.

// Module-scoped on purpose. A long press usually changes the layout — a
// selection bar appears, rows gain a checkbox — and the browser dispatches the
// trailing click to whatever sits under the finger *after* that reflow, which
// can be a different row than the one pressed. A per-row flag never sees that
// click, so the neighbouring row treated it as a fresh tap and selected itself
// too: one press, two songs. A shared timestamp catches it wherever it lands.
