          though it's positioned relative to the viewport, not this box. Each
          panel manages its own height/scrolling instead.

          invisible, not hidden (display:none), when collapsed: ModalOverlay's
          center-on-open effect measures its panel's natural size via
          getBoundingClientRect the moment it mounts — display:none would zero
          out that measurement (a hidden ancestor collapses layout entirely),
          while visibility:hidden keeps it laid out and measurable, just
          unpainted. ModalOverlay calls dock() from that same synchronous
          effect, so the slot flips to visible in the same pre-paint flush —
          no gap where the panel needs to override anything itself. */}
