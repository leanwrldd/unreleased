// Combined network layer for the profile-blob PATCH. Song prefs, listening
// plays, and playlist folders each live as their own JSON field on
// /accounts/account/me/ (see preferencesApi.ts and foldersApi.ts for the
// per-field shapes), but they used to be pushed by three independently
// debounced timers — a burst of edits across more than one field (e.g. a
// song skip, which bumps both playcount and listening plays) fired one PATCH
// per field instead of one PATCH total. This is the single combined pusher
// the store's one shared debounce timer calls into instead.
