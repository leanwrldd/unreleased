# unreleased

A music player for Juice WRLD — stream the full catalog of released and unreleased songs in your browser, install the desktop app for local files, offline playback, and Discord integration, or run it natively on Android and iOS. Powered by the [Juice WRLD API](https://juicewrldapi.com).

> Just here for the web player? See [README.web.md](./README.web.md) for a feature list scoped to what's actually usable in the browser, without the desktop-only stuff below.

## Features

### Browse & discover

- **Tracker** — search the entire catalog (titles, artists, producers), filter by category and era, sort by any column; List, Detailed, and virtualized Grid view modes; collapsible category sidebar with era counts; infinite scroll that stays smooth through thousands of tracks
- **999 FM** — live radio in the WRLD view: real-time metadata over WebSocket, vote to skip, suggest the next song, and preview the upcoming queue — the vote prompt surfaces anywhere in the app, not just on the WRLD page
- **Files** — navigate the API filesystem directly, stream audio, and download files
- **Song info** — full metadata for every track: titles, artists, producers, engineers, era, recording details, dates, and lyrics
- **Bulk edit** — multi-select songs in the Tracker and edit shared fields (era, category, credits, and more) across all of them at once, with per-field replace/add/remove/append/fill/clear
- **Changes feed** — a live stream of recent Tracker edits and comp-file changes, in the optional News tab (enable it in Settings → Appearance → Menu items)
- **Context menus everywhere** — right-click any song, playlist, or the player bar for play, queue, playlist, download, and edit actions

### Playback

- **Gapless playback** — the next track preloads into a second audio slot while the current one plays
- **Radio mode** — 📻 toggle in the player bar plays endless random tracks, pre-fetching the next song and respecting your active category/era filters
- **Queue** — drag to reorder, history and upcoming split, lazy loading for filtered queues
- **Synced lyrics** — karaoke-style highlighting with smooth scrolling, cached per session
- **Fine control** — crossfade (1–12 s), playback speed (0.5×–2× with an optional pitch-shift toggle for nightcore/slowed), sleep timer, and audio output device picker
- **10-band equalizer & effects** — 14 genre presets, L/R balance, mono downmix, skip silence, reverb, and a safety limiter, in a panel you can pop out into its own always-on-top window (`Shift+E`)
- **Last.fm scrobbling** — connect your account in Settings to scrobble what you play, on web or desktop
- **Lock screen support** — Media Session integration shows track info and playback controls on mobile lock screens and notification shades

### Playlists & library

- **Playlists** — Spotify-style hero with 2×2 cover mosaic, custom cover upload, descriptions, drag-to-reorder, and zip-download of all tracks
- **Playlist folders** — organize playlists into folders, including folders within folders
- **Sharing** — share any playlist via public link; anyone can play it without an account
- **Liked songs** — heart in the player bar, synced to your account

### Games & stats

- **Heardle** — name the song from its opening seconds. Daily mode shares one puzzle a day with everyone; Personal replays the same rules on demand; Unlimited is fully configurable (guess count, reveal speed, start point, era/category filters); **1v1** matches you live against another player. Live leaderboards for Today, Streaks, and 1v1. Share your result to the clipboard, Wordle-style
- **Wordle** — guess the song title letter by letter. Type it out on the keyboard (physical or on-screen) or find it by name in the search box; either way the guess has to be a real track whose title is exactly as long as the answer's, so the board narrows the catalog as you go. The keyboard colors in as you rule letters out. Daily shares one title a day with everyone, Unlimited draws them at random (guess count, era/category filters). Streaks, distribution and a spoiler-free share grid
- **Tier List** — rank songs into S/A/B/C/D (or tiers you build and recolor yourself) by dragging them into rows, or tap-to-select then tap-a-row on touch. A personal ranking with no daily puzzle or score, saved locally
- **Wrapped** — a listening summary built from your play counts, filterable by All time / 30 days / 7 days, with a recent-plays timeline

### Personalization

- **Skins** — 9 built-in looks (including a dynamic "Now Playing" skin that recolors the app to match the current cover art), or build your own in a live color editor and import/export skins as files to share
- **Gradient surfaces** — an optional accent-tinted gradient background behind the app, sidebar, and player
- **Fonts** — 7 selectable typefaces for the app, with a separate one for lyrics; independently adjustable text size for each
- **Configurable layout** — sidebar position, a reorderable and hideable side menu (and account-control row), and fully rebindable keyboard shortcuts (with optional global/OS-wide bindings on desktop)
- **Song personalization** — set a custom name, cover art, and preferred version for any song, and track your own play count for it
- **Report & feedback** — flag an issue with any song, or send general feedback, right from the app

### Accounts & community

- **Discord sign-in** — liked songs and playlists sync to the API across devices
- **Editor tools** — submit song edits (a full form or a streamlined Basic layout) and propose new songs for admin review, link song versions, track proposal status, climb the leaderboard, earn badges
- **Contributor role** — apply to contribute file changes (upload, replace, move, delete, new folders) to the compilation; propose right from the Files browser or a dedicated Contributor page, track status from your Contributor Profile, and withdraw a pending proposal any time
- **Admin & Manager tools** — review song-edit and comp-file proposals (searchable, sortable), reports, and applications; manage albums, versions, and tracklists. Managers share the same review powers as Admins, short of full account/security access

### Desktop app

- **Local library** — point the app at your music folders; it reads tags and cover art, supports synced lyrics, and plays everything alongside the API catalog. Multi-select tracks to bulk-edit their tags
- **Metadata editor** — edit tags, cover art, and plain or line-by-line synced lyrics on your local files
- **Import from URL** — paste a link from YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, a direct audio file, or ~1800 other sites (via yt-dlp, downloaded on first use) to add it straight to your library
- **Convert format** — transcode local files to MP3, M4A, Opus, OGG, FLAC, or WAV using ffmpeg, downloaded on first use
- **M3U playlists & Import Titles** — import an `.m3u`/`.m3u8`, or a plain-text list of song titles matched against the catalog, into a new local playlist — drag the file onto the app window, or use the Import buttons; export any local playlist back out as M3U
- **Add to Library** — download any API song, or an entire playlist, for offline playback
- **Discord Rich Presence** — show what you're playing (or the 999 FM stream) on your Discord profile with a live progress bar, real cover art (even for matching local files), and a "Listen on API" link button
- **Application menu** — File/Edit/View/Playback/Help, dockable to the title bar or the side menu
- **Mini player & pop-out windows** — Settings, Song info, the editor, the equalizer, and a small always-on-top mini player can float as separate windows
- **System tray** — now-playing info and media controls in the tray menu, with optional minimize-to-tray
- **Download manager** — live progress and speed for every download
- **Auto-updates** — updates install themselves via GitHub releases; join the beta channel with an access code for pre-release builds
- **Maintenance installer** — re-running the installer offers update, version switch, and uninstall, plus a standalone repair tool for when the app won't launch at all

## Mobile apps

Native Android and iOS builds wrap the same web UI with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com), on their own `android` and `ios` branches. Neither is on an app store — this app ships `unreleased`-catalog content, so both are sideloaded instead:

- **Android** — download the newest `Unreleased-android-v*.apk` from the [releases page](https://github.com/leanwrldd/unreleased/releases?q=android-v&expanded=true); the app also checks for updates itself once installed. Requires Android 7.0+. Adds local library access (SAF), offline downloads, save-to-Downloads, and lock-screen/notification controls on top of the web feature set
- **iOS** — download the newest `Unreleased-ios-v*.ipa` from the [releases page](https://github.com/leanwrldd/unreleased/releases?q=ios-v&expanded=true) and install it via [AltStore](https://altstore.io) or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io) (it's unsigned — there's no Apple Developer account behind it, so your free Apple ID re-signs it on install)

Both branches' READMEs cover their own install/dev instructions in full detail.

## Download

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| Windows | `Unreleased-Setup-x.x.x.exe` (full) or `Unreleased-Setup.exe` (web installer) |
| macOS | `.dmg` — Apple Silicon and Intel |
| Linux | `.AppImage` — native Wayland and X11/XWayland |

All builds are on the [releases page](https://github.com/leanwrldd/unreleased/releases). Or skip the install entirely and use the [web player](https://player.juicewrldapi.com).

## Stack

- **React 18** + **TypeScript 5** — UI
- **Vite 6** — dev server and bundler
- **Zustand** — state management
- **Tailwind CSS** + **lucide-react** — styling and icons
- **Electron 42** + **electron-builder** + **electron-updater** — desktop app, packaging, auto-updates
- **music-metadata** / **node-id3** — local file tag reading and editing
- **youtube-dl-exec (yt-dlp)** — URL import
- **[juicewrldapi.com](https://juicewrldapi.com)** — songs, streaming, lyrics, eras, playlists, auth

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Web dev server (http://localhost:3018)
npm run dev

# Desktop app in dev mode (Vite + Electron)
npm run electron:dev

# Linux: optionally force a display backend while troubleshooting
npm run electron:dev:wayland
npm run electron:dev:x11

# Type-check + production build → dist/
npm run build

# Package the desktop app → release/
npm run electron:build
```

Linux selects Wayland or X11 automatically. Native Wayland intentionally leaves
window placement to the compositor, and the mini player uses a stable panel
height because Wayland does not permit reliable app-driven resizing. Use the
X11 override above if exact programmatic placement is important. Global
shortcuts on Wayland use the desktop portal and may show a one-time compositor
permission prompt.

### Branches

- **`app`** — desktop/Electron source of truth; all development happens here
- **`web`** — deployed web build, served directly at [player.juicewrldapi.com](https://player.juicewrldapi.com); synced from `app` on release
- **`android`** / **`ios`** — native mobile wraps of the same UI via Capacitor; see [Mobile apps](#mobile-apps)
