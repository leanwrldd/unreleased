# Relay Log

Tracks cross-branch "relay" merges — where work from one platform branch
(app/android/ios) is ported into another. Most relays so far have landed on
`web`, but this file covers relays onto **any** branch, not just web — this
file lives only on `app` (removed from android/ios/web to avoid duplication),
but since `app` holds the actual repository that all other branches are
worktrees of, `git log --all` from here sees every branch's full history
regardless of which branch this file is checked out on.

Each entry: the relay commit, the branch it landed on, that branch's version at
the commit, and the `app` branch's version as of the same time.

## How to add a new entry

```bash
# find relay commits not yet logged
git log --all --oneline -i --grep="relay"

# version on the branch the relay commit landed on
git show <commit>:package.json | grep version

# app version as of the same timestamp
ts=$(git show -s --format=%ci <commit>)
app_commit=$(git rev-list -1 --before="$ts" app)
git show "$app_commit:package.json" | grep version
```
