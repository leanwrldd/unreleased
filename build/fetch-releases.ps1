# Bundled into the installer (see build/installer.nsh). Lists released
# versions of the app as "tag|installer-download-url" lines, newest first,
# for the maintenance page's version picker.
#
# Stable versions come from the public GitHub API, unauthenticated, same as
# always. Beta versions are NEVER public GitHub releases (that was the whole
# point of gating them) — they live behind juicewrldapi.com's own backend,
# which this script calls with the entered code when -Code is passed.
#
# Backend contract (implemented server-side, not in this repo):
#   GET  {BetaApiBase}/versions   header X-Beta-Code: <code>
#        -> 200 JSON array [{ "tag": "v1.15.0-beta.1", ... }, ...] on a valid
#           code; 401 on an invalid one.
#   GET  {BetaApiBase}/download?version=<tag>   header X-Beta-Code: <code>
#        -> the installer exe (or a redirect to one); 401 invalid, 404 unknown
#           version. build/installer.nsh sends the header itself when
#           downloading — this script only needs to embed the endpoint URL.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = success (stable list, plus beta entries if a code was given
# and accepted); 1 = couldn't get the stable list at all (network failure);
# 2 = the beta code that was passed was rejected (401) — the stable list is
# NOT written in this case, since build/installer.nsh treats any non-zero
# exit as "don't touch the picker" and simply shows the rejection message.
